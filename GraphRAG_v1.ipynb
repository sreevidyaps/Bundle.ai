        "# GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex\n",
        "\n",
        "[GraphRAG (Graphs + Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) combines the strengths of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) to effectively handle complex queries over large text datasets. While RAG excels in fetching precise information, it struggles with broader queries that require thematic understanding, a challenge that QFS addresses but cannot scale well. GraphRAG integrates these approaches to offer responsive and thorough querying capabilities across extensive, diverse text corpora.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides guidance on constructing the GraphRAG pipeline using the LlamaIndex PropertyGraph abstractions.\n",

        "The GraphRAG involves two steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Graph Generation - Creates Graph, builds communities and its summaries over the given document.\n",
        "2. Answer to the Query - Use summaries of the communities created from step-1 to answer the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Graph Generation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Source Documents to Text Chunks:** Source documents are divided into smaller text chunks for easier processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Text Chunks to Element Instances:** Each text chunk is analyzed to identify and extract entities and relationships, resulting in a list of tuples that represent these elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Element Instances to Element Summaries:** The extracted entities and relationships are summarized into descriptive text blocks for each element using the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Element Summaries to Graph Communities:** These entities, relationships and summaries form a graph, which is subsequently partitioned into communities using algorithms using Heirarchical Leiden to establish a hierarchical structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Graph Communities to Community Summaries:** The LLM generates summaries for each community, providing insights into the dataset’s overall topical structure and semantics.\n",

        "**Answering the Query:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Community Summaries to Global Answers:** The summaries of the communities are utilized to respond to user queries. This involves generating intermediate answers, which are then consolidated into a comprehensive global answer.\n"

(NASDAQ:HSIC) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:\\n\\\"We continue to evaluate new investment opportunities. Despite the volatility of recent months, we see a number of strong tailwinds in certain sectors \\u2014 particularly those that solve big societal problems. One such problem is growing healthcare costs, which will put more pressure on social-security systems and household budgets. Later in this letter we profile Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC), the largest distributor of dental and medical products and services globally. Companies like Henry Schein have the potential to control the growth in healthcare costs, while promoting access to underserved communities.\\nAt the same time, healthcare cost pressures are escalating. To make matters worse, healthcare has worse labour shortages than most industries, while productivity improvements are hard to come by.4 In almost every country, health spending is forecast to form an increasing share of GDP in the coming years.\\nAt Generation, we look for companies that can provide a solution to these long-term challenges. More specifically, we look for healthcare companies that reduce costs and drive efficiency; that improve clinical outcomes; and that improve access to care. Henry Schein, a long-term holding of your portfolio, is an example of a company that we believe can deliver on all three of these criteria...\\\" (Click here to read the full text)\\nHenry Schein, Inc.

        "\n",
        "This functionality is similar to that of the `SimpleLLMPathExtractor`, but includes additional enhancements to handle entity, relationship descriptions. For guidance on implementation, you may look at similar existing [extractors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/property_graph/Dynamic_KG_Extraction/?h=comparing).\n",

        "**Key Components:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `llm:` The language model used for extraction.\n",
        "2. `extract_prompt:` A prompt template used to guide the LLM in extracting information.\n",
        "3. `parse_fn:` A function to parse the LLM's output into structured data.\n",
        "4. `max_paths_per_chunk:` Limits the number of triples extracted per text chunk.\n",
        "5. `num_workers:` For parallel processing of multiple text nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Main Methods:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `__call__:` The entry point for processing a list of text nodes.\n",
        "2. `acall:` An asynchronous version of __call__ for improved performance.\n",
        "3. `_aextract:` The core method that processes each individual node.\n",

        "**Extraction Process:**\n",

        "For each input node (chunk of text):\n",
        "1. It sends the text to the LLM along with the extraction prompt.\n",
        "2. The LLM's response is parsed to extract entities, relationships, descriptions for entities and relations.\n",
        "3. Entities are converted into EntityNode objects. Entity description is stored in metadata\n",
        "4. Relationships are converted into Relation objects. Relationship description is stored in metadata.\n",
